# Delta Debugging Implementation

The simple script `delta_debugging.py` generates reduced test suite consisted of only failure-inducing statements.

For now, it works for one test case and manually specifying `suffix`, `prefix`, and `lines` to actually reduce is needed to avoid compile error.

In this example, `test4()` is used to in `ErrorTest0.java` generated by [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/#getting_randoop).

Any advice to improve and generalize this implementation would be appreciated.
